# bcat's Corne layout

This is inspired by my [BlueMicro
keymap](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_BLE/tree/master/firmware/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/bcat),
which is itself a simplified version of my [QMK
keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/layouts/community/split_3x6_3/bcat).
See the QMK keymap for layout diagrams and rationale.
